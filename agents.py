# Example Python code using a hypothetical CrewAI SDK for multi-agent handling.
# This illustrative design includes:
# - A RootAgent that routes queries to a WeatherAgent or MathAgent.
# - WeatherAgent: Calls a sample weather API (e.g., Open-Meteo) for weather-related queries.
# - MathAgent: Performs a random math operation for other queries.
